# Intro to Beautiful Soup

Day 45 was the introduction lesson's and project to Beautiful Soup and the concept of web scraping. `main.py` is a small project which scrapes an internet archive copy of [Empire's top 100 movies of all time](https://web.archive.org/web/20200518073855/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-movies-2/) and pulls the movie titles while outputting them as a numbered list to the `movies.txt` file.
