# Amazon Price Tracker

For Day 47, I created an app that tracks the price of a given item on Amazon. With the link to an item and a minimum value you choose, the app can be made to run continously and will send an email (can be switched to text pretty easily) when the price gathered through web scraping with BeautifulSoup falls under the given minimum value.

At this point, very little was new from the previous day except the ability to send out an email, which I only had to briefly refresh on as it was taught in a much earlier lesson. This day went by fairly quickly, and while useful was not as interested as far as what I learned. OIne of the big challenges of BeautifulSoup is trying to make the module grab the tag that you need in various situations.
