Selenium Cookie Clicker Bot

Day 49 is an introduction to Selenium and a project using the [classic version of the cookie clicker game](https://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/). The project is about building a "bot" to automatically play the game through well established web scraping techniques, as well as selenium's advanced webdriver to add interaction to the project as well. 

There is a small challenge of setting the code to run for 5 minutes and try to get the highest "cookies per second" value by the end. Her basic score was 106 "CpS" while after some modifications, my algorithm was able to get 142 "CpS". It was a challenging project, but Selenium feels much easier and powerful than something like BeautifulSoup, and I enjoyed programming with it much more. I went a little wild with the process, figuring what "upgrades" were the most efficient at creating cookies at what point. It's not perfect, but I really enjoyed fine tuning it and watching the "CpS" go higher.
