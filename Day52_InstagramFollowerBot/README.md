Instagram Auto Follow Bot

Day 52 involved created a bot that logged into Instagram and given an account name, pulled up the list of followers for 
that account, and sent a follow request to all of them.

This project looked incredibly simple, especially with the previous projects being a lot of the same, but in the end, it 
ended up being a bit frustrating, and taking much longer than I thought. It was a good lesson in that no two sites are 
really built alike, and even though one specific function worked the first time I attempted it in one website, it doesn't
mean it won't require a lot of rework in another website. Being able to search for elements within a stored element turned
out to be a real life saver in this project.
