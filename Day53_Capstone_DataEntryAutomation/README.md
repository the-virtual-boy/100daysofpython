# Data Entry Automation Capstone Project

Day 53 is a Capstone project, which is the final project for a specific topic within the course. This marks the final project for the webscaping section using BeautifulSoup and Selenium, and thus asks to use both modules. The project itself is to create a tool to simulate the automation of a data entry job. Using the backed up search results of a [Zillow.com](https://zillow.com) home rental search, the tool needs to pull the Zillow property link, the address and the monthly rental price of each property and submit that information into a google forms form created just for the project.

This project not only required scraping information and interacting with web pages as before, but had an added challenge of having inconsistent data formats which needed to be cleaned up or "sanitized" before storing it and adding it to the form. It proved a decent challenge, and while I feel there's still a lot more to learn about selenium, I have to say the past few lessons have been a worthwhile deep dive into the tool.
