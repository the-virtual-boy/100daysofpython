# Intro to Flask

Day 54 starts a new subject as is common after a capstone project. This lesson begins the Web Dev and Flask projects. Being the first day, this lesson is mostly just lecture, examples, and videos to watch, so no real project at the end. The lessons included learning about frameworks in general, the `__name__` special attribute built into python, and decorator functions.
