# Higher Lower Game

For day 55, using what was taught last lesson along with some advanced decorator concepts, the project required creating a basic "Higher Lower Game" where after starting the flask server, you need to find the randomly generated number between 0 and 9 by visiting the corresponding numbers route (`http://[address]/0`), `http://[address]/1`, etc), where you'll find a custom page telling you that you're too low, you're too high, or you got the number.

I feel in school, frameworks were the most difficult thing for me, it required a completely different approach rather than a blank file that you fill with whatever you want, and I just wasn't understanding that I needed to switch. I was used to programming being this blank canvas where as long as you're knowledgeable and skilled enough, you can make whatever you want, and while a framework does make it easier to do some very complex things, it also restricts you to a very specific subset of code, and this was completely throwing me off back then. Because of that, I struggled through my GUI programming class, and didn't really take any more programming classes unless it was niche, like embedded programing which only used C. I'm glad to be returning to frameworks, and being able to find a very clean way to understand it's less about "what" frameworks are, and helped me understand the mindset I needed to approach it with.
