# Digital Name Card

Day 56 involved using template rendering of flask to create a digital name card, or simply a page with our name and info as if it were a digital business card. This required downloading a template from online and replace all the images and information with our own to create our personalized name card.

There was a lot of little things in this lesson, which made it feel a little bit underwhelming. Mostly it can be summed up with "How to copy a template online, and change the little things that will break when you do." along with the addition of how to use the `render_template()` function to actually render html files in flask.
