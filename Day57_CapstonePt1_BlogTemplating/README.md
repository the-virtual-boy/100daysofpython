# Capstone Project Part 1: Blog Website via Jinja Templating

For day 57, the focus was on Jinja and its templating syntax. The project used the `render_template()` to pass in variables, as well as calling those variables, other python code, and for loops for quickly creating multiple similar elements through jinja templating in the html file itself.

It was fairly straightforward, and copy/pastable. It was a simple lesson, but also a very quick one, so no real complaints.
