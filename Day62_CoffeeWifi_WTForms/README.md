# Cafe Workability List

Day 62 was pure project for putting all the flask, bootstrap and WTForms stuff together. The goal was to create a functional site that holds a list cafes (apparently in london) and their ratings in 1) coffee quality, 2) Wifi quality, and 3) ease of finding power outlets. The project came with a precreated csv file of 4 cafes which required using bootstrap and flask to make it appear on the `/cafes` page. There is also an `/add` page that required creating a new form, as well as displaying it in the page so that new cafes can be added to the csv, with specific validations depending on the field, any newly added entries should be viewable when returning to the `/cafe` page.

The Cafe project asked for a lot of new fields and bootstrap elements that hadn't be used in any previous project or lesson, and really pushed the need to read documentation and "self-learn". It definitely showed how frustrating it can get when you don't quite understand the documentation for what you're looking for, or worse, not even sure what in the documentation you're supposed to be looking for. After some trial and error, and many head scratches, it all fell into place, and ended up another succesful project.
