# Web Design Practice Website

Day 65 was a bit of a step away from the rest of the recent days, taking a moment to give an introduction to Web Design and concepts of color theory, typography, UI and UX when designing websites. There was no code taught, and so fittingly, the project required no code either. Using the [Canva Website](https://www.canva.com/) the goal is to build a fake website using everything learned about web design.

I followed the instructors simple 3 part home page with a title head, categories middle, and contact me end. The instructors example was a home page for a fake hotel, and instead I decided to do the home page for a blog I have been considering off and on for a little bit now. I started the day rolling my eyes at the artsy topic of Web Design, but came to learn there's a lot of science behind all of it, and it ended up being a lot more interesting than I expected. I ultimately got a lot more into the project than I probably should've, and enjoyed trying to use what I learned to make a better website, but I can tell there's still a lot to learn. This is the only file for in this day, so I'll stick the link for my practice website [here.](https://boozebucket.my.canva.site/)
