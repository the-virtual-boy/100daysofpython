# Version Control/Git Intro

Day 70 was another side step to learn another basic, but necessary concept in development: version control. There were only some small optional challenges on this day but no actual project. There was a link to a website with some challenges to learn more advanced topics, however, found [here](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

I followed the lessons for this day, but obviously I have at least a basic grasp of git and github prior to this lesson, so it was mostly all review. I do plan on trying some of the challenges on the link because concepts like cherry-picking and rebasing are still difficult for me the rare times that I need them.
