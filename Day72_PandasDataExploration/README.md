# Intro to Data Exploration with Pandas

Day 72 was more of a series of lessons to learn using Google Colab, as well as some ways to explore data in a CSV using python's Pandas module. The entire lesson merely required repeating commands to query, organize, and modify data from a csv, as well as a few minor challenge questions to analyze the data with what was taught.

A short day for the third in the row, but looking ahead, it at least seems like this day is setting up for the next few to come. It was a game of follow the leader, with uncomplicated information, but I'm looking forward to move onto the next thing involving Python after web dev.
