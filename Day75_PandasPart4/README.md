#  Data Exploration with Pandas Part 3

Another day of pandas, this time looking into making more customization to line graphs with matplotlib

This really isn't interesting nor difficult to me. It's basically telling me a bunch of commands to get data, and then making me repeat those commands for different sets of data. I hope a project utilizing this stuff with an actual app is coming.
