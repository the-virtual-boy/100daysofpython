# Computation and N-Dnimensional Arrays with NumPy

Day 77 required following instructions once again in a python notebook, this time using NumPy and switching from data visualization to learning the basics of N-Dimensional Arrays and the kind of functions we can perform with them including linear algebra and manipulation of jpg images.

This day looked a lot like the past data visualization days with Panda, but I found it a little more interesting. Perhaps just finally moving to something new, or just a bit of nostalgia from my computer engineering degree background, but playing with the arrays was a lot more satisfying than configuring the 10th graph.
