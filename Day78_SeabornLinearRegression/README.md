# Linear Regression and Data Visualization with Seaborn

Day 78 mixes both the previous data visualization concepts with Numpy and general computations. In this case the project requires using Seabon, a module expenting MatPlotLib to create plots that also show the linear regression line within the data.

While the past few days have been conducted the exact same, linear steps performed on a python notebook. It is getting more interesting to see everything come together, and see the kind of "stories" you can tell with data that actually feel meaningful. I can see a lot of what is learned here to not only graph, but to analize and make predictions about information, such as metrics gathered on a system that could influence decisions such as where to focus on security, what systems need updates due to tech debt the most, etc.
