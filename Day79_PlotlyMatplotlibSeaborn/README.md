# Combining Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn

Day 79 being the final regular lesson day in the course, it combined all the data visualization and computational topics learned in the past couple of days. The goal was to use a list of Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2020 and build various charts to identify trends within the data.

This was the longest, and felt the most tedious out of all the lessons so far, halfway through I ended up compromising with myself to keep me from skipping the second half: I would do all the dataform manipulations and computations to get the values I needed, and I would simply copy the chart code from the solution. I had to be honest with myself and realize that manipulating data is fun, but trying to remember which plot took which parameter, and whether that module used a separate function to change design aspects or not was frustrating and felt like busy work. It wasn't *hard* it was just time consuming and it was sucking out my motivation, so I felt like that was a decent compromise. I think I learned the important part, that these modules exist and all focus on different aspects of chart making, and if I really want to I can fumble through their documentations to try and create the charts I need in the future.
