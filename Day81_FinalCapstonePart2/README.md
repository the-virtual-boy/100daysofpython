# Predicting housing prices in 1978 Boston

Day 81, the final part to the final capstone project for the course continues with what was taught about seaborn and scikit to test models for predicting the prices of a home with various features according to data from a 1978 study in Boston.

More of the same, learned about multivariable regression a bit, but not enough of the theory to make the application make too much sense. All the outcomes make sense, but none of the underworkings, such as why the logerithimic value for home prices creates a stronger prediction than the regular prices. The past few days covered some really cool concepts, and the idea of them is really interesting, but practicing them without having context on the innerworking math just wasn't the best execution, and even when I didn't need to look at the solution, it felt more like I was guessing right more than knowing what I was actually doing. What I learned was cool, but taught in such a shallow method that I will forget 90% of it by next week unfortunately. I at least know what modules and docs to look intoi whenever that times comes, or worst case, I just come back to the course, but for now, onto the professional portfolio projects.
