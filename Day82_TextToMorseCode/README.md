# Morse Code Encoder/Decoder

This is a basic command line tool that takes input text or morse code and encodes it or decodes it depending on the mode.


## Usage

1. Run the app with `python main.py` in the project folder.

2. Enter either a `D` or `E` whether you would rather encode or decode the message.

3. Enter plain-text if encoding, or morse code if decoding.

4. Enjoy your encoded/decoded message!
