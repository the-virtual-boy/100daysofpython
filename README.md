# 100daysofpython
My journey through the 100 Day of Python course.

As I go through the [100 days of Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code), I will be documenting what I code and what I learn here.

Each project has its own folder, continue to the project to see a short description of what it is and how it works.

## Structure
A little explanation on the general pattern of the folders. Most will have at least:

- `lesson.py`: Any short, instructional code taught in the days lesson videos to get used to a concept, module, or strategy.
- `main.py`: Always be the final task, or project for that day.

Some days will only be a larger project with no lesson, and usually marks a final project to wrap up learning a big topic. Any other named python files will usually be smaller wholey contained mini-projects usually given as more of a lesson than a do-it-yourself project. Text files, HTML files, and any other noon-python files are supporting files for either the project or the lesson and will be explained in within that day itself.
